                        <p>My name is Noah Schnur, and I was born and raised in Berkeley, Ca. I went to a private school K-8 in El Cerrito, then I went to Berkeley High School and graduated in 2008. After graduating, I went to the University of California, Santa Cruz where I graduated in 2012 and received a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. While at UCSC, I spent my junior year abroad in Ireland, continuing my major, while also taking a lot of cultural classes. In Ireland, I lived in Cork and studied at University College Cork. </p>
                        <p>Once graduating from UCSC, I started working towards becoming a zookeeper. Zookeeping is a challenging field to have a career, so after interning at the Oakland Zoo, I moved to Arkansas for an internship and my first full time position was at the El Paso Zoo. I am currently an Animal Trainer 1 at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, and I have been there for about 2 years. I am currently taking the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp as it is time for a career change, and I believe that programing is an interesting field to move into with many exciting options.</p>
