            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Berkeley, Ca. I went to a private school K-8 in El Cerrito, then I went to Berkeley High School and graduated in 2008. After graduating, I went to the University of California, Santa Cruz where I graduated in 2012 and received a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. While at UCSC, I spent my junior year abroad in Ireland, continuing my major, while also taking a lot of cultural classes. In Ireland, I lived in Cork and studied at University College Cork. </p>
            <p>After college, I started working towards becoming a zookeeper. I interned at the San Francisco Zoo in their Education Department in 2013, then in 2014 I completed 2 consecutive internships at the Oakland Zoo, working with a lot of different types of animals. In August 2014, I moved to Arkansas for a new internship at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge. TCWR rescues large carnivores from private ownership, mostly big cats such as lions, tigers, leopards, and ligers, but they will also take in small cats like bobcats and cougars. They also have black and brown bears, and a smattering of other animals like a macaw, a deer, a goat and a pig.  </p>
            <p>I completed 2 six-month internships at TCWR, at which point I returned to volunteer at the Oakland Zoo while I was applying to full time jobs nationwide. It took about 9 months to find a full-time job, this time I moved from Berkeley to El Paso, Tx. I spent about 2 years in Texas before moving home. I am currently an Animal Trainer 1 at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, and I have been there for about 2 years.  </p>
